Ambient Light Detector Circuit

Project involves designing and implementing a circuit that detects the ambient 
light level and compares the light level to a pre-set reference value. 
- If the ambient light is more than the reference, the circuit should produce a digital high output of ‘1’ (3.3V); 
- If the ambient light is less than the reference, the circuit should produce a digital low output of ‘0’ (0V).
